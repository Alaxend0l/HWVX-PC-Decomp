/* Basic types for this decompilation (32-bit x86, Visual C++, written in C++). Agents add structs, classes and
 * prototypes here or in new headers next to it.
 *
 * The game's functions are func_<address> and its data D_<address>: write them as free functions or as a class's
 * methods (`void Town::func_0041B470(int id)`), with the original's calling convention (methods: this in ecx; free
 * functions: __cdecl, __stdcall or __fastcall, as the code shows). The build gives what they compile to the
 * original's symbol names, so any C++ name mangling pairs with the game's code. Data: `extern int D_00402034;`. */
